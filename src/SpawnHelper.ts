/*
MOVE            50      Moves the creep. Reduces creep fatigue by 2/tick. See movement.
WORK            100     Harvests energy from target source. Gathers 2 energy/tick.
                        Constructs a target structure. Builds the designated structure at a construction site, at 5 points/tick, consuming 1 energy/point. See building Costs.
                        Repairs a target structure. Repairs a structure for 20 hits/tick. Consumes 0.1 energy/hit repaired, rounded up to the nearest whole number.
CARRY           50      Stores energy. Contains up to 50 energy units. Weighs nothing when empty.
ATTACK          80      Attacks a target creep/structure. Deals 30 damage/tick. Short-ranged attack (1 tile).
RANGED_ATTACK	150     Attacks a target creep/structure. Deals 10 damage/tick. Long-ranged attack (1 to 3 tiles).
HEAL            250     Heals a target creep. Restores 12 hit points/tick at short range (1 tile) or 4 hits/tick at a distance (up to 3 tiles).
TOUGH           10      No effect other than the 100 hit points all body parts add. This provides a cheap way to add hit points to a creep.
